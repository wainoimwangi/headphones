# Web Page development

This is a simple README file for the web page project. The project is developed as part of an ALX Introduction to Software Engineering program.

## Project Overview

The web page project aims to create a basic webpage using HTML, CSS. It serves as a starting point for learning web development and understanding the fundamental concepts of front-end programming.In this project, I will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that I have learned previously.

## Features

The web page includes the following features:

- A responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Navigation bar for easy navigation through different sections of the page.
- Introduction section with a brief description of the project.
- Services section highlighting the key services provided.
- Testimonials section featuring feedback from satisfied clients.
- Contact form to allow visitors to get in touch.
